# Ruby Capstone Project
## Fritz The Librarian Bot

> A Telegram Bot that recommends books of a chosen genre and sends random quotes according to the user's mood.

### Why a librarian bot?
> Nowadays, many people would rather look at memes on instagram than take the time to sit down and enjoy a good read.
Perhaps in a few years, human librarians will no longer exist, as everything will be fully automated. 
As a friendly reminder for children and adults, the librarian bot is the ideal synthesis between modern technologies and old habits that should not be lost.
